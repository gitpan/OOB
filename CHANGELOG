0.05	29 February 2008
	Added many more tests.

	Can now also specify allowable attributes at compile time with
	parameters to "use".

	Now cloaks OOB from ref() and Scalar::Util::blessed(), so that
	checks on the refs don't suddenly change behaviour because an
	attribute has been added.

0.04	29 February 2008
	Removed use of prototypes altogether, so that we're not hindered by
	older, more limited, prototype capabilities of Perl before 5.8.0.

	Dave Rolsky pointed out I meant "out-of-band" rather than
	"out-of-bounds".  Documentation adapted accordingly.

0.03	29 February 2008
	Renamed to OOB, at the suggestion of abeltje.

0.02	28 February 2008
	Removed "our" from $VERSION to get a clean compile on 5.005005,
	reported by srezic@cpan.org.

0.01	27 February 2008
	First version of oob.
